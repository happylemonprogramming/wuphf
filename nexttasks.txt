build security by using environmental variables and configuration files
environmental variables can be used to store the key to access the configuration file
for example, the configuration file can have the username as the key and password as value
this file can be encrypted with sha-256
the private key for decryption can be an environmental variable

this gives write permissions to the configuration file (new users)
it also gives multiple tiers of security (environmental var, encrypt, configuration file)
another layer would be for it to live on another server for key distribution
